                To start off, the definition of “violence” in the dictionary is “an unjust force.” This would mean punching, kicking, slapping, shooting, saying bad words, stabbing, and so on are not always violent. We would need to decide what “unjust” means to completely
                define violence, but since justice depends on each situation and we can't really make a strong definition for it, I think violence is someone using power for the purpose of hurting people. Therefore a police officer stopping a terrorist
                attack by shooting them down is not violence, but a terrorist shooting down a police officer is violence.

                I think the more harmful the action becomes, the more violent. For example, stabbing a person will likely be more violent than slapping them, because it creates more physical harm and probably more emotional harm, by having other effects such as trauma.

                Unfortunately, people do resort to violence every now and then. Domestic violence is very often reported on the news, and so are murder and robbery. I think it is the human mind’s natural concept to want to harm something or someone whenever feeling stress
                or anger. I myself sometimes want to kick my sister for not doing chores she promised to do or kicking me for sitting in “her seat” at the dining table that was never assigned. However, since I am a peaceful and nice person, I offer to
                play rock-paper-scissors with her to make sure the loser does the chore, with me losing most of the time for some reason.

                In the world today where so many things are internet-centered, we sometimes have situations where we cannot resort to violence and need to solve problems or stop arguments using words. We need to learn how to solve these problems in peaceful ways, since
                as the world develops further, we will have even less opportunities to be able to punch the opponent in the face, at least physically. We never “need” to be violent in order to teach a child something or to seek revenge on someone, and
                we should be growing up from the old ways soon.
