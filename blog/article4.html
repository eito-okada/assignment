                The definition of fear is "A very unpleasant or disturbing feeling caused by the presence or imminence of danger", and <br> The definition of phobia is "An anxiety disorder defined by a persistent and excessive fear of an object or situation".
            </p>

                Phobias are often thought of as "irrational" fear compared to other fear people feel, such as trauma. I think all phobias have reasons, and I found 4 ways a phobia can build up inside a person.
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <p>The first one is when something bad happens in some particular situation causing the situation to become scary. <br> For example, an experience of tripping over something in the dark may make the dark freightening.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another is watching somebody else being scared of something. <br> For example, if a child who went to a zoo with a parent that was scared of elephants, they might learn that elephants are something to be scared of, and unconsciously
                    grow fear against them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The third one is hearing or reading that something is dangerous. <br> Reading an article about how drowning is the 25th most common way to die globally could make someone scared of bodies of water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly, there is fear that is inherited through genes. Though not much about the system is understood, studies such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.14272"><b>this one</b></a> show that passing on fear down generations
                    is something that actually occurs in animals.
                </li>
            </ul>

                My greatest fear is standing in the batter's box, although I literally am in the baseball club and play in games. I was in 4th grade when I was hit in the head during a game, and though I was totally fine because I was wearing a fat helmet, the feeling
                of a baseball coming straight at my head was very scary, and to this day baseballs that come even a little bit close to my body during my at-bat make me freeze and panic mildly.

                This fear has made me do dumb things in games, such as when a pitcher threw 3 balls consecutively near my head and then two strikes right down the middle which I couldn't swing at. I felt the urge to swing at the next ball, which was significantly out
                of the strike zone, and I ended up striking out from a 3-0 count.
                <br> Fear has also caused me to not like batting compared to other things as well. I instead practice a lot of pitching. However, the sport is fun, and I like playing it.
            </p>
            <p class="text">I do feel that I don't want fear to get in the way for me to challenge new things or continue to do things I enjoy.</p>
