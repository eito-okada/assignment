                It is said that people get the ability to and start to lie at around 4 years old and get better at it as we grow. Lying is a process that consists of complex and logical thinking.
                <br> In order to lie, it is necessary to think up alternate episodes and explanations for a particular situation. We always lie for somebody, whether it be somebody else or ourselves.
                <br> There are many cases when we lie for our own benefit.
            </p>
            <p>Some examples are:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Evading punishments</li>
                <li>stretching truths to become socially accepted in a group of people</li>
                <li>hiding information to keep from being picked on about it</li>
                <li>ironically, to gain trust, by lying about having experience or accomplishments</li>
            </ul>
            <p> We also lie for other people's benefit. <br> Some examples of it are: </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Sparing a friend's feelings by not telling a friend about how bad their food actually is</li>
                <li>Not reporting a friend to the police for illegal activities</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">
                Lying sounds like a very bad thing to do. However, in reality, many lies are usedf to prot4ect people, whether that be someone else or themselves. According to a study done in Canada in 2018, the most common lie was a white lie.
                <br><b> The answer to "why do we lie?" might be "because we are nice to people".</b>
