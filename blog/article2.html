            It is said that people get the ability to and start to lie at around 4 years old and get better at it as we grow. Lying is a process that consists of complex and logical thinking. In order to lie, it is necessary to think up alternate episodes and explanations
            for a particular situation. We always lie for somebody, whether it be somebody else or ourselves.
            <br> There are many cases when we lie for our own benefit. Some examples are: lying for self-protection, such as evading punishments stretching truths to become popular or socially accepted in a group of people hiding information to keep from
            being picked on about it ironically, to gain trust, by lying about having experience or accomplishments We also lie for other people's benefit. Some examples of it are: Sparing a friend's feelings by not telling a friend about how bad their
            food actually is Not reporting a friend to the police for illegal activities
